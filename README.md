This is meant to be a food delivery esque website that allows users to order food and have it delivered to their address.

It is ran on a locally and the entry point is in main.py, which, when ran, gives you a development server link in the terminal.

What I learned working on this project: 
-The Flask framework
-How to GIT from VSCode / use GitHub / first time using VSCode
-Coding in python 
-Database handling. Adding, deleting, get/query.
-POST/GET requests, routing/connecting URL to functions, connecting functions to HTML buttons and forms
-Little bit of HTML (most of the HTML was done by Shuling)

Website is capable of:
-Render HTML files with some CSS in them. Bootstrap is also used to create a navbar
-These functions:
  -add/remove to cart functionality
  -add/remove items in the existing menu
  -sign up,sign in,log out
  -checkout, although only a proxy
  

Website is NOT capable of:
-Handling payment. (We can use a paypal api in the future)
-Dynamically displaying items (menu is currently hardcoded)
-Approximate time of delivery and distance of delivery person
-Record reviews and feedback
-Show promotions and discounts

There is still work to do!
